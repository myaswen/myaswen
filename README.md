### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer concentrated in web development using JavaScript (ES6), Python, HTML5, and CSS3. Alongside those languages, Iâ€™m skilled with React, Redux, Express.js, Sequelize, Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, SQL, Git, and Node.js. Check out my public repos to see what Iâ€™ve built using these technologies!

Previous to studying software engineering, I worked as a team lead at a startup that specialized in building accessory dwelling units (also known as tiny houses). While there, I spent a lot of time working with software solutions to help increase efficiency in our production processes. One of those software solutions was a web app created by the founders of the company, which triggered a greater interest in software for me. This background has instilled in me the importance of forward planning and attention to detail. Iâ€™m eager to find my role in a team that shares the same valuesâ€“and contribute to something great!
